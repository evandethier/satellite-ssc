Estimating suspended sediment concentration (SSC) using a globally applicable calibration for surface reflectance satellite images

Calibration has been completed for Landsat 5 and 7 LT1 Surface Reflectance Product (USGS/NASA)

![Figure 1. Stations with in situ data used in Landsat 5 and 7 calibration models. Colors indicate river cluster group, determined by typical spectral signature at that station.](/Readme_figures/fig1_cluster_map_n6.pdf)

![Figure 2. (a,b) Number of clusters was chosen by minimizing relative calibration model error and at-a-station bias. (c,d) Average cluster color for different suspended sediment concentrations, which is related to typical percent organic carbon content. ](/Readme_figures/cluster_combined_fig.jpeg)
