## Estimating suspended sediment concentration (SSC) using a globally applicable calibration for Landat 5 and 7 surface reflectance satellite images ##

Calibration has been completed for **Landsat 5 and 7** LT1 Surface Reflectance (SR) Product (USGS/NASA)

The calibrations described here were made using 134,697 *in situ* measurements at 727 stations in the United States (United States Geological Survey, USGS), Canada (Water Survey of Canada, WSC), South America (HYdro-geochemistry of the AMazonian Basin, HYBAM), and Taiwan (Water Resources Agency, WRA). 

The code included here is used to 
  -Download data from online repositories
  -Generate calibrations
  -Apply calibrations to predict SSC for Landsat 5 and 7 SR data
  
**Standalone calibrations for rivers in the calibration dataset**
In addition to the globally applicable calibration methods, standalone calibrations for 151 rivers are available.

These can be found in the [standalone calibration subfolder](landsat-57-standalone-calibrations)

For example, this is a standalone calibration from **WSC station 05GG001**, 

North Saskatchewan River at Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, CA

[53.20344,-105.77214]
